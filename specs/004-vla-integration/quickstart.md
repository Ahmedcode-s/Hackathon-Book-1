# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems Module

## Overview
This module teaches how humanoid robots integrate vision, language, and action to understand natural language commands and execute appropriate physical behaviors. The module is structured as 4 chapters with supporting materials.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this module, students should have knowledge from:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Chapter Progression

### Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action with Speech Recognition
- Understand the speech recognition pipeline
- Learn how voice commands are converted to robot actions
- Explore challenges in real-world speech recognition

### Chapter 2: LLM-Based Cognitive Planning for Robots
- Explore how Large Language Models enable cognitive planning
- Understand task decomposition and reasoning
- Learn about integration with robot systems

### Chapter 3: Vision-Guided Action and Manipulation
- Discover how visual perception guides robot actions
- Learn about object recognition and manipulation
- Understand multimodal integration

### Chapter 4: Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid
- Integrate all VLA components
- Explore complete system architecture
- Understand end-to-end workflows

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, students will be able to:
1. Explain Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems architecture
2. Understand voice-to-action systems with speech recognition
3. Describe LLM-based cognitive planning for robots
4. Understand vision-guided action and manipulation
5. Conceptualize complete autonomous humanoid workflows
