# Planning Quality Checklist: RAG Retrieval Pipeline Validation

**Purpose**: Validate plan completeness and technical approach before implementation
**Created**: 2026-01-05
**Plan**: [specs/007-rag-retrieval-validation/plan.md](../plan.md)

## Technical Completeness

- [x] Architecture clearly defines components and data flow
- [x] Implementation steps are ordered logically (Phase 1-5)
- [x] Dependencies are explicitly identified
- [x] Technical context matches feature requirements
- [x] Error handling strategy is comprehensive
- [x] Configuration approach aligns with existing system

## Implementation Feasibility

- [x] Each phase has clear, achievable objectives
- [x] Dependencies can be resolved from requirements
- [x] Technical approach matches constraints (single file, Python)
- [x] Embedding model matches ingestion pipeline
- [x] Qdrant integration approach is viable
- [x] CLI interface meets requirements

## Risk Management

- [x] Potential risks are identified
- [x] Mitigation strategies are provided
- [x] Error handling covers likely failure modes
- [x] Validation approach ensures quality

## Success Criteria Alignment

- [x] Success criteria are specific and measurable
- [x] Criteria align with feature requirements
- [x] Validation approach enables verification

## Notes

- All validation items pass - plan is ready for implementation
