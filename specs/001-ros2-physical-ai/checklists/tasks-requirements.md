# Tasks Quality Checklist: ROS 2 as Middleware for Humanoid Robot Control

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and quality before implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-21
**Feature**: [Link to tasks.md](../tasks.md)

## Format Validation

- [X] All tasks start with checkbox `- [ ]`
- [X] All tasks have sequential Task IDs (T001, T002, etc.)
- [X] [P] markers used only for parallelizable tasks
- [X] [US1], [US2], etc. labels used only for user story tasks
- [X] All tasks include specific file paths in descriptions
- [X] Setup and foundational phases have no story labels
- [X] User story phases have appropriate story labels
- [X] Final phase has no story labels

## Content Quality

- [X] Tasks organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5)
- [X] Each user story has clear goal and independent test criteria
- [X] Phase dependencies clearly defined
- [X] Parallel execution opportunities identified
- [X] Implementation strategy documented
- [X] All 5 user stories from spec included as phases

## Completeness

- [X] Phase 1: Setup tasks included
- [X] Phase 2: Foundational tasks included
- [X] Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks (P1 priority)
- [X] Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks (P2 priority)
- [X] Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks (P3 priority)
- [X] Phase 6: User Story 4 tasks (P4 priority)
- [X] Phase 7: User Story 5 tasks (P5 priority)
- [X] Phase 8: Polish & cross-cutting tasks included
- [X] Dependencies section included
- [X] Parallel execution examples included
- [X] Implementation strategy section included

## Implementation Readiness

- [X] Tasks are specific enough for LLM execution
- [X] File paths are accurate and follow project structure
- [X] No vague or ambiguous task descriptions
- [X] All tasks align with specification requirements
- [X] Tasks follow Docusaurus documentation approach

## Notes

- All validation items have passed
- Tasks are ready for implementation phase
- Each user story can be implemented and tested independently
