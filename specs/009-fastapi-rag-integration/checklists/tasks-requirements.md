# Tasks Quality Checklist: FastAPI RAG Agent Integration

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and quality before implementation
**Created**: 2026-01-12
**Feature**: specs/009-fastapi-rag-integration/tasks.md

## Task Format Compliance

- [x] All tasks follow the required format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [x] All tasks have sequential Task IDs (T001, T002, etc.)
- [x] Parallelizable tasks marked with [P] label
- [x] User story tasks marked with [US1], [US2], [US3] labels
- [x] All tasks include specific file paths where applicable
- [x] Setup and foundational tasks have no story labels
- [x] Polish phase tasks have no story labels

## Task Completeness

- [x] All user stories from spec have corresponding task phases
- [x] Each user story has sufficient tasks to be independently testable
- [x] All functional requirements from spec are addressed by specific tasks
- [x] API contract elements (inputs, outputs, errors) are covered by tasks
- [x] Both backend API and frontend component tasks are included
- [x] Error handling and validation requirements are addressed
- [x] Testing and integration tasks are included

## Dependency Mapping

- [x] Dependencies between phases are clearly identified
- [x] Sequential dependencies are properly ordered
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities are identified
- [x] Critical path is identifiable from task dependencies

## Implementation Readiness

- [x] Tasks are specific enough for immediate execution
- [x] Each task can be completed without additional context
- [x] File paths are accurate and reflect the project structure
- [x] Task breakdown enables iterative development
- [x] MVP scope is identifiable (User Story 1 tasks)

## Quality Assurance

- [x] Tasks align with architectural decisions in plan
- [x] Non-functional requirements are addressed
- [x] Risk mitigation strategies are incorporated
- [x] Definition of Done criteria are reflected in tasks
- [x] All key entities from spec are addressed

## Notes

- Tasks are comprehensive and ready for implementation
- All user stories have sufficient tasks for independent testing
- Parallel execution opportunities are clearly marked
- Dependencies are properly mapped between phases
