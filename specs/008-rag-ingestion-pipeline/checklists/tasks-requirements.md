# Tasks Quality Checklist: RAG Ingestion Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate implementation tasks completeness and quality before development
**Created**: 2026-01-08
**Feature**: [specs/008-rag-ingestion-pipeline/tasks.md](../tasks.md)

## Format Compliance

- [x] All tasks follow checklist format (- [ ] T### ...)
- [x] Task IDs are sequential and in execution order
- [x] Parallel tasks marked with [P] tag
- [x] User story tasks marked with [US#] tag
- [x] Each task includes clear file path or location

## Task Completeness

- [x] Setup phase covers project initialization
- [x] Foundational phase includes shared utilities
- [x] User stories mapped to separate phases in priority order (P1, P2, P3)
- [x] Each user story has implementation tasks mapped to acceptance scenarios
- [x] Final phase covers polish and cross-cutting concerns

## Dependency Mapping

- [x] Tasks from specification requirements included
- [x] Implementation plan tasks incorporated
- [x] User story dependencies properly ordered
- [x] Blocking relationships identified

## Implementation Feasibility

- [x] Each task is specific enough for implementation
- [x] File paths clearly indicated
- [x] Task scope is manageable
- [x] Dependencies between tasks clear

## Test Coverage

- [x] Each user story has independent test criteria
- [x] Acceptance scenarios mapped to implementation tasks
- [x] Success criteria from spec addressed

## Quality Assurance

- [x] MVP scope identified (US1)
- [x] Incremental delivery approach clear
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities identified
- [x] All functional requirements covered

## Notes

- Tasks are comprehensive and ready for development
- All user stories properly implemented with acceptance mapping
