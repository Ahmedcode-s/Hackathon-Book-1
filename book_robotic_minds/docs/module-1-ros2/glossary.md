# Glossary: ROS 2 and Humanoid Robotics

## A

**Action**: A ROS 2 communication pattern for long-running tasks that provides feedback and the ability to cancel the task.

**AI Agent**: An intelligent system that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve goals, often implemented in Python for integration with ROS 2.

## B

**Behavior Controller**: A ROS 2 node that manages high-level robot behaviors such as walking, grasping, or balancing.

## C

**Communication Pattern**: The method by which ROS 2 nodes exchange information, including topics, services, and actions.

## D

**Distributed Computing**: A ROS 2 system design where multiple computers work together in a robot system, communicating via ROS 2 middleware.

## E

**Embodied Intelligence**: The concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment, facilitated by ROS 2's communication infrastructure.

## G

**Goal**: In ROS 2 actions, the definition of the task to be performed by an action server.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with a human-like structure, typically including a head, torso, arms, and legs.

## I

**Inertial Properties**: Physical properties in URDF including mass, center of mass, and moments of inertia that define how a link responds to forces.

## J

**Joint**: In URDF, the connection between two links that defines the kinematic relationship and allowable motion.

**Joint Controller**: A ROS 2 node that manages the position, velocity, or effort of robot joints.

## L

**Link**: In URDF, a rigid body that represents a part of the robot structure.

## M

**Middleware**: Software that acts as a bridge between operating systems and applications, in ROS 2's case enabling communication between robot software components.

## N

**Node**: The fundamental execution entity in ROS 2, an executable that uses ROS client libraries to communicate with other nodes.

## P

**Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through robotic platforms, often using ROS 2 as middleware.

**Publisher**: A ROS 2 component that sends messages to a topic.

## Q

**QoS (Quality of Service)**: Settings in ROS 2 that allow fine-tuning of communication behavior, including reliability, durability, and history policies.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides middleware for communication between robot components.

**Robot State Publisher**: A ROS 2 node that reads joint positions and publishes coordinate transforms for visualization and navigation.

## S

**Service**: A ROS 2 communication pattern that provides synchronous request-response interactions between nodes.

**Subscriber**: A ROS 2 component that receives messages from a topic.

## T

**TF (Transforms)**: The system in ROS 2 that manages coordinate frame transformations, essential for robot localization and navigation.

**Topic**: A ROS 2 communication mechanism using a publish-subscribe pattern for asynchronous message passing.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing robot models, including kinematic structure, visual appearance, and physical properties.

## V

**Visualization**: The representation of robot data and state in tools like RViz for monitoring and debugging.

## X

**xacro**: An XML macro language that extends URDF with variables, expressions, and reusable macros.

## Z

**Zeroconf (Zero Configuration)**: The ability to set up and operate a ROS 2 network without manual configuration of network addresses.
