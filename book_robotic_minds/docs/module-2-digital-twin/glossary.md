# Glossary of Terms

## D

### Digital Twin
A virtual representation of a physical robot system that mirrors its real-world counterpart for simulation, testing, and analysis.

### Dynamic Behavior
The way objects move and interact in response to forces and constraints in a physics simulation environment.

## G

### Gazebo
A robotics simulator that provides accurate physics simulation and realistic rendering for robot development and testing.

## H

### High-Fidelity Visualization
The rendering of realistic visual environments that closely match real-world appearance and lighting conditions.

## I

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
A sensor that measures specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body using accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.

## L

### LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances and create 3D representations of the environment.

## P

### Physics Simulation
The computational modeling of physical laws and interactions in a virtual environment to create realistic robot-world interactions.

## S

### Sensor Simulation
The computational modeling of sensor outputs that replicate real sensor behavior in virtual environments.

## U

### Unity
A real-time 3D development platform used for creating high-fidelity visualizations and interactive experiences for digital twins.
