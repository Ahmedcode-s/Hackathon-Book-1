## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems with 75 specific, actionable tasks organized across 8 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - 3 tasks for module directory structure
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** - 5 tasks for basic module files
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1)** - 9 tasks for VLA systems concepts
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2 (P2)** - 11 tasks for voice-to-action content
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3 (P3)** - 11 tasks for LLM planning content
6. **Phase 6: User Story 4 (P4)** - 11 tasks for vision-guided action content
7. **Phase 7: User Story 5 (P5)** - 11 tasks for capstone integration
8. **Phase 8: Polish** - 14 cross-cutting tasks

All tasks follow the required checklist format with:
- Proper checkboxes: `- [ ]`
- Sequential task IDs: T001 through T075
- User story labels: [US1] through [US5] for relevant tasks
- Specific file paths and clear descriptions
- Mapping to functional requirements and success criteria

MVP scope defined as Chapter 1 completion with all supporting materials.
Parallel execution opportunities identified for chapter content creation.
Each user story represents a complete, independently testable increment.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for Module 4 VLA documentation
- 🧪 Tests: Task completeness validation and Docusaurus build validation
- 📁 Files: tasks.md created with 75 structured tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task execution phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Task list provides clear roadmap for content creation with proper prioritization

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow required format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard tasks generation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin executing tasks starting with Phase 1
